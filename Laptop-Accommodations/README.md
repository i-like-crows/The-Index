# Laptop Stand
---
Creating a vertical laptop stand to clear up space on my desk.

Project progress: ~5%
* Considering methods for keeping laptop upright while making the stand usable across various devices


# Laptop Rack
---
Creating a rack for a laptop to sit on under a shelf.

Project progress: Brainstorming
* Idea: Mounts clip onto front and back side of shelf
  * Needs to be low enough to lift laptop lid and press power button
  * Print clips? Make from sheet metal? Laser cut?
    * Clips and sheet metal seem to be best option, lowest profile
