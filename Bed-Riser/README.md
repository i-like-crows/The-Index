# Bed Risers
---
**Preliminary Ponderings**
- Bed height currently ~6.5" off the floor, case is ~10" tall
- Wheel is ~1.5" of frame height
- ~~Leg w/o wheel therefore ~4"~~~
- This is wrong, leg actually 5"
- Make post 6.5", drill hole 1" deep in top

**Problem**: Bed is too low to fit my instrument case underneath, and I don't want the case to continue taking up space in my room

**Solution**: ~~Deal with it~~ Build some legs to boost the frame up

**How Done**: For a long time, I've toyed with the idea of making a loft bed to free up space in my room. While this might have been nice 10 years ago, it's no longer a good solution. Instead, I decided to create some risers to fit the legs of the bed frame I have, and call it good.

My bed frame has bent sheet metal legs that are round at the bottom, but flare out into triangles at the top. Ideally, there'd be a few inches of the frame leg going into the riser, but because the flare extends to around an inch from the bottom, I needed to make do.

After bouncing some ideas off my parents, I decided to use some left over cedar 4x4 for the risers. I took measurements of the legs and instrument case to calculated the minimum height I'd need the legs to be. After that, I set up a chop saw with a stop block to make sure the legs would be a consistent length.  

Four cuts\* later and I had the beginnings of the risers! (\* The chop saw actually had the bottoming out screw slightly down, so the saw wasn't getting full extension. So it was more like 4 and a couple until the issue was pointed out to me)
