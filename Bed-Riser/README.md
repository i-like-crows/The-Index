# Bed Risers
---
**Preliminary Ponderings**
- Bed height currently ~6.5" off the floor, case is ~10" tall
- Wheel is ~1.5" of frame height
- ~~Leg w/o wheel therefore ~4"~~~
- This is wrong, leg actually 5"
- Make post 6.5", drill hole 1" deep in top

**Problem**: Bed is too low to fit my instrument case underneath, and I don't want the case to continue taking up space in my room

**Solution**: ~~Deal with it~~ Build some legs to boost the frame up

**How Done**: For a long time, I've toyed with the idea of making a loft bed to free up space in my room. While this might have been nice 10 years ago, it's no longer a good solution. Instead, I decided to create some risers to fit the legs of the bed frame I have, and call it good.

My bed frame has bent sheet metal legs that are round at the bottom, but flare out into triangles at the top. Ideally, there'd be a few inches of the frame leg going into the riser, but because the flare extends to around an inch from the bottom, I needed to make do.

After bouncing some ideas off my parents, I decided to use some left over cedar 4x4 for the risers. I took measurements of the legs and instrument case to calculated the minimum height I'd need the legs to be. After that, I set up a chop saw with a stop block to make sure the legs would be a consistent length.  

Four cuts\* later and I had the beginnings of the risers! (\* The chop saw actually had the bottoming out screw slightly down, so the saw wasn't getting full extension. So it was more like 4 and a couple until the issue was pointed out to me)

 Now that I had the blocks, I needed to mark the centers so I could drill both the pilot holes and the \~3/4 inch holes. Ideally, I would have made the holes with a drill press for repeatable depth and 90 degree angles. I don't have a drill press however, so I marked 1 inch from the end of the bits and drilled until the tape met the surface of the wood.

 I used something like a 1/8 inch bit for the pilot hole and a 3/4 inch spade bit for the final holes.

 I then sanded all of the blocks with an electric palm sander and tested them out. The fit was good but not snug, and the bed wobbled a bit too much for comfort.

 This was about what I'd expected so the next step was to cut some wider base plates for better stability. (Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures of this process) Using some 1/2 inch ply scrap we had, I cut 4 squares at 4 3/4 inches, routed the edges with a 1/8 inch round cutter, and sanded all the faces. I marked four points on each piece for screws, then drilled pilot holes through each plate and in each riser. I countersunk the holes in the plywood for a flush mount, then screwed all of the plates to risers.

 The final thing to do was to test them out!

The fit was as good as before but now with the wider bases, the risers were much more stable. I'm quite pleased with the result!

**What Learned**: A few takeaways, I would probably do well to take more photos of the process in order to make things more clear. I might come back to this with some drawings of certain parts in order to clarify some of the points that aren't the easiest to follow. This was a two weekend project, so I've been able to sit down and write things up pretty quick. However, I intend to write on future projects as they happen which might keep details clearer in my head. Thanks for reading!
